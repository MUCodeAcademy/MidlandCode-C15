We will also be working on one of the following.

## FULLY Finish the Giphy App

It should be worked into a completely finished application and have the following things:

- Proper styling including styled reusable components (following atomic design as needed)
- Best practice for folder layout
- Route protection and anything else missing.
- If you have not tried implementing redux, do so.
- Think about and create folders for layout if you had an API to send or delete favorites.
- Try adding the ability to sign up or compare a list of prebuilt users when they try and log in
