# Classwork

We're going to take what we've learned so far and create a new application using the tools at our disposal. We'll be adding more functionality to the todo application, but for added practice, it might be worthwhile to start from scratch. Our application will need the following:

- Input field for owner
- Input field for Title
- Input field for a comment
- Input field for priority level
- A button on each todo that will allow you to edit each possible field of the todo
- A button in the "editable" version of the todo that confirms edit decisions
- The ability to keep track of what item was most recently added
- Buttons to delete items from the list
- Separate out your components as needed
- See what you can do to update the folder structure to separate things out even further
- Search bar that matches based on search text and highlights todo text wherever it is (title, owner, comment)
- Looks pretty
Since we will be green-fielding this project try to lay out the components as you would for maximum reusability.
