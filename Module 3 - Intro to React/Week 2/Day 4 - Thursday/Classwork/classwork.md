# Classwork

We're going to take what we've learned so far and create a new application using the tools at our disposal. We'll be adding more functionality to the todo application, but for added practice, it might be worthwhile to start from scratch. Our application will need the following:

- A field to add or remove certain items
- The ability to keep track of what item was most recently added
- Buttons to delete items from the list
- Separate out your components as needed
- See what you can do to update the folder structure to separate things out even further

Since we will be green-fielding this project try to lay out the components as you would for maximum reusability.
