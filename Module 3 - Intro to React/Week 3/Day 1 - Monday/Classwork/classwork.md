We're going to keep expanding on how Todo. Let's implement the following:

- Add an effect to your Todo application that will keep the most recently added Todo in a separate section at the top
- Add an effect to keep a counter for how many characters they've typed in one (or all) of the inputs
- Start a timer when the application loads and have the counter stop when the component un-mounts
