# Classwork

Take our project we started yesterday and let's add some actual state to it.

- Try to add the element to the array of Todos itself so it displays to the page, to see how that will work.
- Try adding sorting and/or filtering to the list of displayed todos

## Homework

Finish up the implementation for the todo app over the time off. Don't worry too much about styling or making it look nice for now, we'll talk about some UI libraries next week that we can use for that.
