# Classwork

Using what we currently know, we will be doing the following:

- Create a simple application that allows for a user to input a username and a title for a todo
- Create a pre-built list of todos to start with
- Display all of the pre-built todos to the page
- When a user adds a todo, log that new todo to the page (it won't visually be added to the todo list until tomorrow).
- Think about how clean you can make this with more specific components / usage knowing what you know now.
