# Extra LeetCode Problems if you want a challenge

This is a list of LeetCode problems that you should be able to do with the knowledge you have now for additional practice. However, there are a lot of JavaScript functions we haven't learned yet, and those will be helpful to solve some of them (for example, the [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) method will probably be useful). 

Despite being labeled "easy", keep in mind that these questions will still be quite difficult for you at this point. Try them out for a bit, and if you get stuck, take a look through the JavaScript solutions tab.
