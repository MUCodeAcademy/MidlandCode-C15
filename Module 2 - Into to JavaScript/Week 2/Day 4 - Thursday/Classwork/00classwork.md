## Personal Project

You have a few options for your personal project - which one you do is 100% your call. They are all listed inside this classwork folder.

I ordered the projects from what I believe to be easiest to hardest, however this does not mean that the To-Do List project is necessarily "easy". JavaScript is hard, so there really is no "easy" project. Additionally, the Drawing Pad is quite hard, mostly because it's going to require extra research about topics we haven't learned about (how would you get the user to draw on the screen?). However, it's good practice for after you finish this course, since you'll have to research on your own when you want to learn something new.

If you get done with one of the projects, feel free to add more functionality than what is listed, or try the other ones if you need more practice.
