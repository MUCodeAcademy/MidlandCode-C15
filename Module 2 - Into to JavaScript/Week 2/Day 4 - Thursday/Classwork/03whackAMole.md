## Whack-A-Mole Game

Build a whack-a-mole game:
   - Create a grid of divs / containers on your page. They should all be the same size and be at least a 5x5 grid although you can add more if you would like
   - Create a start button that the user can click to start the game
   - When the game starts, show a timer for X amount of seconds. X can be any value you would like but should be no more than 30 seconds.
   - Every second or every random amount of time, have one of the divs light up by adding a class to it. After a reasonable (your call) amount of time remove the color change to that div and have it revert to normal.
   - If a user clicks one of the divs while it is lit up, a score counter at the top should increment by one.
   - After the timer ends, the cycle should stop and the user should see their score and have the ability to start a new game. Starting a new game should reset the score and start over.

   ## Bonus Requirements

   - Add the ability to choose a difficulty when the user starts the game.
