# Classwork

We're going to continue our simple application that will allow us to chat with anyone else connected to it. We will need the following things to make it work:

- Some form of Authentication so we know who the user is, this can be custom or through Google FireAuth
- A backend to handle the sockets server side. We won't need an API or anything for this so it's going to be fairly simple.
- Two components at minimum (might be more depending on how you're designing the application)
  - Login component
  - Chat Component (Could be split into more components)

If you feel like focusing on topics you need to brush up on / cement, feel free to do the following:

- Work on any personal review provided
- Ask any questions you have over confusing topics.
- Go back and refactor code in your projects from earlier in class.

Think about how we might set up our sockets using native WebSockets as opposed to `socket.io`
