# Classwork

We're going to create a simple application that will allow us to chat with anyone else connected to it. We will need the following things to make it work:

- Some form of Authentication so we know who the user is
- A backend to handle the sockets server side. We won't need an API or anything for this, so it's going to be fairly simple.
- Two components at minimum (might be more depending on how you're designing the application)
  - Login component
  - Chat Component (Could be split into more components)
