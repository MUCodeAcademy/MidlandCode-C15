# Classwork

- We will be continuing to implement authentication this afternoon. If you're feeling adventurous, try setting up (as a mock up or for real) authentication using some form of OAuth technology. Make sure you are fully taking advantage of your time to pick up any remaining skills you might need to brush up on regarding authentication as we will be deploying this week.

- We'll also be implementing a simple FireAuth example
