## So now it's time to build a server! But first, what is Express?

- Express is one of several modules that allow for easy construction of HTTP servers.
- They can be run on multiple different platforms including locally on your own machine.
- Incredibly robust and allows you to serve html files to be rendered client-side, or render files server-side.
- Also allows for interaction with databases via client facing APIs.
- Can also do anything node does and handle all sorts of wonderful things!

## So how do we get started?

- There are a ton of options for what you can use for scaffolding, or setting up options but the BARE minimum is something like:

```javascript
// Imports the Express library and sets it to a variable called 'express'
const express = require("express");

// Creates a new instance of Express
const app = express();

// Sets up a variable that holds what port our server is on
const port = 3000;

// When a GET request is made to the root of the server, it executes this function
// The function takes two arguments: req (request) and res (response)
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello World!"));

// Starts the server and makes it listen on the port.
// It also runs the function which just logs a message to the console.
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`));
```

- So that's great if you want a server to just say `Hello World!`. If you want it to do more we'll have to start looking at more options!

## Basic App Configuration

- You can set up `app.use()` to declare specific things you want to use in the whole app. This can be for routes (see below), middleware (see below), specific modules etc.
- If you're using the express generator you'll probably see stuff like:
  ```javascript
  app.use(logger("dev"));
  app.use(express.json());
  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
  app.use(cookieParser());
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));
  ```
- All of the above is telling the entirety of the application to use those specific modules when the server is running.

## Configuring Routes

- So you already saw the `app.get` or `app.listen` but that's not the ideal way to declare routes. One of the best ways is to declare them as their own custom files.
- Let's say we have a `/users/` router that has `/users/posts` and `/users/settings` and `/users/friends` etc. Well we could declare all of those in the top file sure, but ideally we keep like with like.
- Those could then be separated out into a `user.routes.js` file (this is the naming convention but doesn't require `routes` in the file name). In there you could declare

  ```javascript
  const express = require("express");
  const router = express.Router();

  router.get("/posts", (req, res, next) => {
    res.send(postData);
  });
  router.get("/settings", (req, res, next) => {
    res.send(settingsInfo);
  });
  router.post("/settings", (req, res, next) => {
    //Functionality to post to settings
  });

  //etc...
  module.exports = router;
  ```

- The above is great for a standalone bit of routing. You can then tell your application to use it in the top level file with
  ```javascript
  const usersRouter = require("./routes/users");
  app.use("/users", usersRouter);
  ```
- So what do the `req` and `res` mean in the callback function?
  - `req` is the request being made and contains all sorts of information you can use. [More Req Options](http://www.expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req)
  - `res` is the response you're planning on sending back. [More Res Options](http://www.expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res)
  - These don't have to be the only arguments passed into the callback and don't have to be named `req` and `res` BUT they're always the first two arguments and ALWAYS in that order.
- If you want to declare parameters to a route it's super simple! Let's say you want `/users/SOMEUSERID/posts`
  - In the route declaration simply declare it like `router.get('/users/:userId/posts') etc...`. From there you can get it in the callback function by accessing: `req.params.userId` look familiar?
  - This can be done for multiple params as well such as (from the Express guide) `router.get('/flights/:from-:to' etc..)` and then access them with `req.params.from` and `req.params.to`
- You can also take advantage of `res.sendFile()` to deliver static files (great for React apps with client side rendering).

## So what if you want all routes for `/users` to go through an authorization process of some sorts ahead of time, or some other functionality?

Middleware:

- Sometimes you want to make custom functionality. Let's say you want to take every request to the servers `/users` routes and check to see if a token/api key matched
- You COULD declare that function at each call inside the callback. But instead you could declare it as a standalone function:
  ```javascript
  function checkAuth(req, res, next) {
    if (req.whateverTokenKeyYouWant) {
      next();
    } else {
      res.send("Invalid token");
    }
  }
  ```
- In this case, `next()` tells the server that this middleware is done and to move on to the next one. If you don't send a response in a route or exit out of a middleware with `next()`, the server will NEVER conclude the call (well, it will time out eventually).
- In your routes you can now simply call `router.get('/route', checkAuth, (req,res,next)=>{})` and it will automatically call that middleware.
- Alternatively you could use the `router.all` or `app.all` and attach middleware to ALL routes or all http methods to a specific route (`router.all('/users', middleware, callback)` would attach to any `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` to `/users`)

## Starting up the server

All of the above is great, but how do we start it up? Easiest way is to run `node SERVER_FILE_NAME` in the terminal. Since it is a node app, it will start up the server. That method though requires you to restart the server every time something changes in the files though. You can also utilize the `nodemon` package if you'd like. Install it with `npm i nodemon` and then setup a script in your `package.json` to start up with `nodemon SERVER_FILE_NAME` instead of `node` that way as you save and update files, it will automatically restart for you!
