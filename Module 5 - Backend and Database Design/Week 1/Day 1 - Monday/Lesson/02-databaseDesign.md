We'll be building a fictional database for a Twitter (X) clone so you can see how that might work. Think about how you can design interconnected tables. We're going to start basic with only the following needs (in no particular order):

- A post
  - the content!!!
  - has likes
  - has reposts
  - comments
  - user handle
  - views

- A user
  - posts
  - followers
  - followees
  - messages
  - notifications
  - scheduled posts?

- Communities
- Grok
