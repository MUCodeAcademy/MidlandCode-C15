## In Class Work

- Create a weekly schedule for yourself:

  - This should include 7 days (M-Su) as table headers across the top
  - There should be three table headers vertically along the left side for "Morning","Afternoon","Evening"
  - At least one item should span across multiple columns
  - At least one Item should span across multiple rows
  - Add styling (either in-line or via external stylesheet) to ensure it is working properly for multiple columns / rows

- Extra options:

  - Add a contact form with pertinent information about you or a fictitious service that you would want to know from the customer
  - Include at least 1 text, 1 set of radios, 1 set of checkboxes, and one select

- Set up the rest of the page around those two elements to make a fully-fledged page
