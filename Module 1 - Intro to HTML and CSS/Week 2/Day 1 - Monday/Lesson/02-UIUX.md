# Introduction to User Experience Design

_Source: [Interaction Design Foundation: What is User Experience (UX) Design?](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design)_

User experience design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.

Usability –
_A user interface should be easy to become familiar with and competent in on the first attempt to use it. Users should be able to easily achieve their objectives with no interruptions to service or task, and easily recall how to use the interface on later attempts._

Graphic Design –
_User experience design is different from user interface/graphic design in that user interface design is the visual facet of the user experience; the two are not interchangeable as the look-and-feel of a product is not the only facet required to achieve an effective user experience._

Accessibility -
_A user interface should be designed with every user in mind and take into account any feature, functionality, or factor that could exclude users from your target demographic. Examples include but are not limited to color blindness, limited mobility or motor skills, learning disabilities, hearing and vision difficulties or complications, language barriers, etc._

### **Useful.**

As practitioners, we can’t be content to paint within the lines drawn by managers. We must have the courage and creativity to ask whether our products and systems are useful, and to apply our knowledge of craft and medium to define innovative solutions that are more useful.

### **Usable.**

Ease of use remains vital, and yet the interface-centered methods and perspectives of human-computer interaction do not address all dimensions of web design. In short, usability is necessary but not sufficient.

### **Desirable.**

Our quest for efficiency must be tempered by an appreciation for the power and value of image, identity, brand, and other elements of emotional design.

### **Findable.**

We must strive to design navigable web sites and locatable objects, so users can find what they need.

### **Accessible.**

Just as our buildings have elevators and ramps, our web sites should be accessible to people with disabilities (more than 10% of the population). Today, it’s good business and the ethical thing to do. Eventually, it will become the law.

### **Credible.**

Thanks to the Web Credibility Project, we’re beginning to understand the design elements that influence whether users trust and believe what we tell them.

### **Valuable.**

Our sites must deliver value to our sponsors. For non-profits, the user experience must advance the mission. With for-profits, it must contribute to the bottom line and improve customer satisfaction.

## Stanford Guidelines for Web Credibility

_Source: [Stanford Web Credibility Research](http://credibility.stanford.edu/guidelines/index.html)_

1. Make it easy to verify the accuracy of the information on your site.

   _You can build web site credibility by providing third-party support (citations, references, source material) for information you present, especially if you link to this evidence. Even if people don't follow these links, you've shown confidence in your material._

2. Show that there's a real organization behind your site.

   _Showing that your web site is for a legitimate organization will boost the site's credibility. The easiest way to do this is by listing a physical address. Other features can also help, such as posting a photo of your offices or listing a membership with the chamber of commerce._

3. Highlight the expertise in your organization and in the content and services you provide.

   _Do you have experts on your team? Are your contributors or service providers authorities? Be sure to give their credentials. Are you affiliated with a respected organization? Make that clear. Conversely, don't link to outside sites that are not credible. Your site becomes less credible by association._

4. Show that honest and trustworthy people stand behind your site.

   _The first part of this guideline is to show there are real people behind the site and in the organization. Next, find a way to convey their trustworthiness through images or text. For example, some sites post employee bios that tell about family or hobbies._

5. Make it easy to contact you.

   _A simple way to boost your site's credibility is by making your contact information clear: phone number, physical address, and email address._

6. Design your site so it looks professional (or is appropriate for your purpose).

   _We find that people quickly evaluate a site by visual design alone. When designing your site, pay attention to layout, typography, images, consistency issues, and more. Of course, not all sites gain credibility by looking like IBM.com. The visual design should match the site's purpose._

7. Make your site easy to use -- and useful.

   _We're squeezing two guidelines into one here. Our research shows that sites win credibility points by being both easy to use and useful. Some site operators forget about users when they cater to their own company's ego or try to show the dazzling things they can do with web technology._

8. Update your site's content often (at least show it's been reviewed recently).

   _People assign more credibility to sites that show they have been recently updated or reviewed._

9. Use restraint with any promotional content (e.g., ads, offers).

   _If possible, avoid having ads on your site. If you must have ads, clearly distinguish the sponsored content from your own. Avoid pop-up ads, unless you don't mind annoying users and losing credibility. As for writing style, try to be clear, direct, and sincere._

10. Avoid errors of all types, no matter how small they seem.

    _Typographical errors and broken links hurt a site's credibility more than most people imagine. It's also important to keep your site up and running._

## Examples of Bad UXD and How to Fix Them

### Design pitfalls:

1. Information Overload:
   _The excess of information available to a person aiming to complete a task or make a decision, which can cause undue stress in the decision-making process._
   Best Practices: - Understand what your users need, then design based on that. - Use visuals instead of text to reduce clutter.
2. Mystery Meat Navigation:
   _Navigation where the destination of a link is not visible until the user clicks on it or points a cursor at it._
   Best Practices: - Always label links.
3. Adding Friction to User Actions:
   _An interaction that inhibits the user from intuitively and painlessly achieving their goals within a digital interface._
   Best Practices: - Avoid adding any kind of friction as far as possible, and implement it carefully when you have no alternative.
4. “Clever” Design that Ignores Usability
   Best Practices: - Clever designs should always be made as foolproof as possible and/or tested on actual users.
5. Superfluous Animations
   Best Practices: - Animate deliberately. - It takes more than 12 principles. - Useful and necessary, then beautiful. - Go four times faster. - Install a kill switch. - Always make your animation purposeful.
