# Personal React Project

This application should allow for you to display your React skills learned so far. Unlike the other projects we have been doing, this will be used to display both your creativity AND your talent. As a whole, the content is not as important as the functionality. Use this to flex your muscles and work on something you are passionate about. The more passionate you are about something you code, the better you can talk about it. All of that in mind, the project should have at least the following:

- Utilize form control (in whatever way you prefer) on a form with at least 4 inputs.
- Utilize routing including some from of AuthGuard(s).
- Utilize State Management in some form, whether it's `useState`, `Redux`, `Context`, or any other option
- Utilize some sort of animation. This can be one you have already done, but add some animation to the page.
- Feel free to utilize some sort of styling library like MUI or any other one you want.
- Follow best practices for separation of files and folder structure.
- Add at least one test. If you have extra time, feel free to add more.
- Challenge yourself.
- Utilize GitHub with branches and commits using best practice.

If you need a list of ideas of what projects to make, [Here's a list of free, public APIs you might want to use](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

You'll be able to work on the project this week as well as over the break.
